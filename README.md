# Supervised-Triangulation

main.R  main function to carry out the computation for 2D supervised FPCA with triangulation

utility_fun.R  functions that are sourced into the main function 

train_dat synthetic dataset for training the model

test_dat synthetic dataset for testing the model prediction performance

Tr.est  coordinates of triangles used to set up the simulation study

V.est  vertices of the triangles 

Z  expanded grid for the for the rectangluar box containing the object with irregular boundary
